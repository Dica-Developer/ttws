  "body": "# ttws - TomTom Watch Synchronizer\r\n\r\nTTWS is an application that builds a UI for the command line tool [ttwatch](https://github.com/ryanbinns/ttwatch).\r\nIts mainly developed to download activities from a TomTom sports watch and\r\nupload them to the [STRAVA](https://www.strava.com) website on a Linux system. It allows also to update\r\nthe firmware, GPSQuickFix and time of the watch. It shows also metadata like firmware version of the connected watch.\r\n\r\nYou need to have the ttwatch utility pre-installed on your system.\r\nLater versions of ttws may have them included.\r\n\r\n## Start the application from the source code\r\n\r\n1. Install [nodejs+npm](https://nodejs.org/) (I recommend to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for that)\r\n2. git clone https://github.com/Dica-Developer/ttws.git\r\n3. cd ttws\r\n1. npm install\r\n2. npm start\r\n",
